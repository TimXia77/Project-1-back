  title: 'Project #1 - Pendrive Inventory Management Software'
  description: >-
    >A pendrive inventory management app that requires users to create accounts. Users can then look through available pendrives and request what they would like. 
    
    >-
    Focuses on using a RESTful api and Government of Canada's Web Experience Toolkit.
    
      >- To achieve the statelessness requirement of REST architecture, data will be stored as json strings in textfiles. The textfile that stores account information should not be accessable by users.
    
    >-
    Basic accounts can only request pendrives. Admin accounts can also add pendrives to the available pool of products.
